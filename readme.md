Our tool helps programmers by calculating the total energy consumed by a program.

Basically,our tool provides an IDE to write a C program and then it compiles and runs it and displays the energy meter i.e., total energy consumed by program.

Instructions and their corresponding energies are taken from referring few research papers:
Instruction-Level Power Consumption Estimation Embedded Processors Low-Power Applications, 
The Influence of Microprocessor Instructions on the Energy Consumption of Wireless Sensor Networks.

Dependencies:
  We used Tkinter python for Graphical User Interface. 
  CYGWIN to compile and to generate .s file(assembly code).
  save the C program in the same directory as ide.py
setup:
	Run ide.py
